# Tic Tac Toe AI

This project focuses on making an AI for playing Tic Tac Toe. This isn't the hardest of games to master. It also easily can be solved with a dynamic programming algorihtm. The reason this game was chosen is that it is a simple way to introduce a machine learning approach using neural networks with "[Evolution Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03864)" to make a [Markov Decision Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) example.

The overall strategy is interesting since it can be used to solve many classes of problems such as playing games and training automation.
