# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

This is my repository for AI and ML work. I've been doing this work off-and on since 2022, largely motivated by the release of [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) and later [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT).

Why post this code? Neural networks have been used in some really clever ways and learning the algorithms and strategies is fun. Working on them full time will be my day job one of these days. It is helpful to have notes! You may find them helpful too.

## Frameworks, Programming Languages and Learning Resources

I try to create examples using both [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), which are popular frameworks. Likely what you'd use professionally. Hugging Face has [Tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks) are many great examples that use the previously mentioned frameworks too.

Most code examples are in Python but I'll also include some Java, C/C++ CUDA and Linux CLI. These too are the main methods you'd likely use professionally.

## Examples

These are all a mix of examples you should be able to easily run yourself.

## Manuscripts, Courses and Documentation

Notes from review of related topics, manuscripts, documentation and, generally other interesting resources to learn from.

* [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](docs/latent-diffusion/README.md) by R. Rombach et al. 2022
