# High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models

This is commonly referred to as the Stable Diffusion paper since it was published with [Stability AI's initial models
and algorithm](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-public-release) for [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-diffusion).


## Try out Stable Diffusion

Some nice Google Colab workbooks that let you run Stable Diffusion for free can be found on this page for ["Stable Diffusion in TensorFlow / Keras"](https://github.com/divamgupta/stable-diffusion-tensorflow). Try [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15mQgITh3e9HQMNys0zR8JN4R2vp06d-N), if you aren't sure where to start.
